How github copilot works?
- Reads the comment and generate logic
- Remembers the previously generated logic in the same file and uses that information to generate new code.
- Generate Markup as well
- Generate javascript logic according to the UI elements
    - E.g. If we create a form and a table we can simply write a comment in javascript that "Collect the form data and bind to the table"

Issues detected
- Sometime it generates same lines again and again
